Introduction
============

Three types of computational models covered.  

1.  Descriptive models

*   How do neurons respond to external stimuli nd how do we describe this quantitatively with a neural encoding model
*   How can we extract information from neurons

2.  Mechanistic Models

*   How can we simulate the behaviour of a single neuron on a computer?
*   How do we simulate a network of neurons?
    i.e. The Human Brain Project

3.  Interpretive or Normative Models of the Brain

*   Why do brains operate the way they do?
*   What are the computational principles underlying their operation?

Software Required
-------------------

Use MATLAB or the open source Octave <http://www.gnu.org/software/octave>

Some Goals

1.  Quantitatively describe what a biological neuron or network of neurons is doing given experimental data
2.  Simulate on a computer the behaviour of neurons and networks.
3.  Formulate computational principles underlying the operation of neurons and networks in the brain.
